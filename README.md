# Arduino projects

This repository will contain different Arduino projects.

## License

This repository will host many Arduino projects, some of them will be projects
written by me and some won't. For every project written by me, there will be an
explicit reference to the MIT license inside its folder.

For projects written by others, I will keep its original license in its own
folder and references to the authors. A common example of this are libraries.
